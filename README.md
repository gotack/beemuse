Beemuse for [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
=================

This is a growing collection of components enhancing Bootstrap.

Now updated for Bootstrap 2.1 (coming out August 20th :)

The Paper and Stitches components can be used similarly to Bootstrap [wells](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#misc).

The 3D Flips component can be applied to any element, including Bootstrap [thumbnails](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#thumbnails).



Quick start
-----------

To get started, take a look at http://beemuse.com!

Simplest: include beemuse.css after bootstrap.css (and before bootstrap-responsive.css if in use)

Advanced: modify included scss files with customizable variables and mixins (requires SASS 3.2)

Modular: modify beemuse.scss to include just the modules you wish
