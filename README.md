Beemuse
=================

This is a growing collection of front end CSS3 components I'm soon planning to release as a Ruby Gem... September 2012 :)

Dependencies: [Compass](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass) & [SASS](https://github.com/nex3/sass)

Suggestions: use with [Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation) or [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)



Quick start
-----------

Demos & Docs: http://beemuse.com

Simplest: include beemuse.css in the <head> section of your page

Advanced: modify included scss files with customizable variables

Modular: include just the modules you wish in beemuse.scss
