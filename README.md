Beemuse for [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
=================

This is a growing collection of components enhancing Bootstrap.

The Paper and Stitches components can be used similarly to Bootstrap [wells](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#misc).

The 3D Flips component can be applied to any element, including Bootstrap [thumbnails](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#thumbnails).



Quick start
-----------

To get started, checkout http://beemuse.com!

Simplest usage: include beemuse.css after bootstrap.css and (optionally) before bootstrap-responsive.css

Advanced usage: modify included SCSS files with customizable variables and mixins (requires SASS 3.2)
