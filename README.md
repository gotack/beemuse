Beemuse
=================

```shell
bower install beemuse
```

***Important Note!*** This repo is for the website http://beemuse.com.  I've packaged up the src .scss files and dist .css files at https://github.com/itmustbe/package-beemuse

I'm planning on releasing these components separately in the future, as I rewrite them.  I've done one so far: the paper component.  You can install by cloning https://github.com/itmustbe/beemuse-paper or running:

```shell
bower install beemuse-paper
```
